I'm a Data Engineer who came up through quantitative trading. For four years I put real capital behind time-series models; now I build the high-availability, real-time data systems I wished I'd had. Earlier, four years in Civil Engineering project management taught me to deliver under constraints and communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

**Philosophy:** Data quality, latency, and reliability aren't "tech details"—they're business risk. When a pipeline fails and decisions can't wait, you learn to design for failure, instrument everything, and ship only what you can monitor.

### How I build
- **Product-minded:** Pipelines aligned to decisions & KPIs, not just storage
- **Quality & reliability first:** Unit tests + dbt data tests, SLAs/SLIs, lineage
- **Cost-aware by design:** Partitioning, pruning, caching, orchestration, right-sizing
- **Data contracts:** Work backward from outcomes to schemas, ownership, and alerts

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack
- **Languages & Databases:** Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Parquet  
- **Big Data & Processing:** PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake
- **Orchestration & Transformation:** Airflow, dbt, MLflow
- **Data Quality:** Great Expectations, Soda  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (S3, Lambda), CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **Specialties:** Time-Series, Streaming, Real-Time Systems, Data Modeling
- **APIs & Visualization:** REST/WebSocket, FastAPI, Streamlit
